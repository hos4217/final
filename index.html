            <h2>Use RTX Raytracing to Cripple your FPS</h2>
            <p>
                Using our new patented RTX technology, gamers can cripple their fps in ways even less noticable than before! What was once a revolutionary technology
                to be rendered by filmmakers and in simulations can now be done locally on your machine. Beware though, there's a reason Disney measures their movie rendering
                in seconds per frame instead of frames per second. Order a compatibile NVIDIA card today (stock unavailable until 2023) to experience frame drops more immersively
                than ever.
