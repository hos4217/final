            <p style="text-align: center;">
                Using our new patented RTX technology, gamers can cripple their fps in ways even less noticable than before! What was once a revolutionary technology
                to be rendered by filmmakers and in simulations can now be done locally on your machine. Beware though, there's a reason Disney measures their movie rendering
                in seconds per frame instead of frames per second. Order a compatibile NVIDIA card today (stock unavailable until 2023) to experience frame drops more immersively
                than ever.</p>

        <h2>Power up your game with RTX enabled realtime raytracing</h1>

        <div id="rtx-on"></div>
        <p style="max-width: 60%; margin:auto;"><br />Raytracing as a technology is not new, but the implications of it being doable in realtime during interactive media such as gaming are immense. What
            was previously only capable of being rendered over days using cutting edge professional equipment can now be done using unavailable consumer equipment that
            might as well not exist due to a lack of stock. That's not to mention how it tanks gaming performence for what is arguably a minor change in graphical fidelity
            compared to standard rasterization techniques. It's a good thing DLSS is available, because otherwise you'd need to actually turn down your settings from ultra
            to get that beloved 144hz at 2k resolution. Who needs to compromise when you can camp in front of a Microcenter for days to get a product that was released a year ago
            at 3x MSRP. Sucker!
